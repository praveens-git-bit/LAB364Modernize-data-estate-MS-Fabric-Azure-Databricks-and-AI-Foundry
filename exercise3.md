## Exercise 3: Building an AI-Powered Chatbot with Microsoft Fabric and Azure AI Studio

Contoso encountered a major issue with customer churn, especially among millennials. The executives at Contoso struggled to understand this customer segment and figure out how to earn their loyalty. Despite having extensive data from customer interactions, surveys, and market research, Contoso found it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the churn and determine effective solutions. 

The main problem was the lack of integration in their existing systems. This prevented Contoso's executives from utilizing their data for root cause analysis and strategic insights, which in turn, hampered their ability to improve marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences. 

To solve the data silos issue, Contoso implemented an advanced AI solution using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Microsoft Fabric. Once the team discovered that millennials were leaving because they couldn't find products, they developed an Azure OpenAI-powered shopping assistant to help with product search and recommendations. 

In this exercise, we will learn how they achieved this! 

### Task 3.1: Integrate Fabric data with Azure AI Studio using Azure AI Search

### Task 3.2: Establish Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Content Safety, and AI Search Connections in Azure AI Studio

Contoso integrated all of their data sources using Microsoft Fabric, including customer feedback, sales records, social media interactions, and encompassing internal company policy documents such as SOPs and research articles on customer behavior into Azure AI Search. 
This created a unified, searchable knowledge base. 

Let's step into Data Engineer, Eva's shoes to see how.

1. In a new tab of your VM browser enter the URL ``portal.azure.com``  and press **Enter** key.

2. Search for **prj-build-<inject key= "DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, and select **prj-build-<inject key= "DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** service from the results.

   ![st04.png](media/prj.png)
    
3. Click on the **Studio web URL**.

   ![st04.png](media/std.png)

   >**Note:** Close any pop-up that appears on the screen throught the lab.

   ![st04.png](media/st04.png)

   >**Note:** Click on the **Expand** icon, if the left navigation is hidden.

   ![prjexpand.png](media/prjexpand.png)

2. Scroll down and click on the **Management center** from the bottom of the navigation menu.
